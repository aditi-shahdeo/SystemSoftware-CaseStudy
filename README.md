>Lexical Analyzer and
>Parser

Developed a lexical analyser which takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences . It breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing whitespaces or comments from the code and returns symbol table as the output.

The parser takes symbol table as the input and checks for the correct syntax and returns error messages if any.
